# Project hacking!

This repository contains projects that I worked on as a part of MLH Global Hack Week as well asrelated ones. Each top-level folder represents a workshop that I attended and decided to implement on my end. Here's a laundry list (not exhaustive) of the projects I worked on:

- Hack Planner
- Next.js based workshop

Each project has its own README.md file covering project specific details!
